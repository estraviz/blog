## Hello, World!

My name is **`Javier Estraviz`** and I'm a **`Data Engineer`**. I am currently working for [👚**Lookiero**](https://lookiero.es/), the online Personal Shopper service, present in many European countries.

Previously, I was a `Technical Program Manager` at [**StubHub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub), an [{{< awesome fab fa-ebay >}}**eBay**](https://www.ebay.com/) company for many years. Before that I was the `IT Recruiter` of [**Ticketbis**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ticketbis), the Spanish startup ticketing marketplace acquired by eBay in 2016. Back in the years I occupied various positions (from `Programmer` to `Team Lead`) in several consulting firms (_everybody has a past!_).

## Motivation

The main motivation for me about having a blog is to help me in my lifelong learning process. Anyhow, I think it's always a beneficial process just to have some time to think and put your ideas into written words.
