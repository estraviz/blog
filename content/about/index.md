## Hello, World

My name is **`Javier Estraviz`** and I'm a **`Data Engineer`**.

I am currently working in [🔬 **Frontiers**](https://www.frontiersin.org/), the open access publisher of scientific journals (the 6th largest academic publisher and 3rd most-cited publisher, January 2024).

Before that, I was working in [👚 **Lookiero**](https://lookiero.es/), also as a **`Data Engineer`**. Lookiero is the online Personal Shopper service, present in many European countries.

Even before that, I was a `Technical Program Manager` at [🎟️ **StubHub**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub), an [{{< awesome fab fa-ebay >}}**eBay**](https://www.ebay.com/) company for many years.

Previously, I was the `IT Recruiter` of [🎫 **Ticketbis**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ticketbis), the Spanish startup ticketing marketplace acquired by eBay in 2016.

Back in the years I occupied various positions (from `Programmer` to `Team Lead`) in several 👔 consulting firms (_everybody has a past!_).

## Motivation

The main motivation for me about having a blog is to help me in my lifelong learning process. Anyhow, I think it's always a beneficial process just to have some time to think and put your ideas into written words.
