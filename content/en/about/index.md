## Hello, World!

My name is `Javier Estraviz` and I'm a `Data Engineer`, currently working for [Lookiero](https://lookiero.co.uk/), an online Personal Shopper service.

Previously, I was a Technical Program Manager at [StubHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub), an [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/) company for many years. Before that I was the IT Recruiter of [Ticketbis](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ticketbis), the Spanish startup ticketing marketplace acquired by eBay in 2016. Back in the years I was a Programmer/Analyst/Team Lead in some consulting firms (_everybody has a past!_).

## Motivation

The main motivation for me about having a blog is to help me in my lifelong learning process. Anyhow, I think it's always a beneficial process just to have some time to think and put your ideas into written words. 


## Main interests

* `Data Engineering`, `Distributed Systems`, `Big Data`
* `Clean Code`, `Clean Architectures`, `Software Design`
* `Machine Learning`, `MLOps`
* `Foreign Languages`
* `Chess`

## Some of my previous blogs (inactive)

* [AgileDataScientist](https://estraviz.github.io/estraviz2017/), the previous version of this blog (up to 2017).
* [YoHabloIdiomas](https://yohabloidiomas.wordpress.com/), a blog about foreign languages.
* [YoHablarAleman](https://yohablaraleman.wordpress.com/), a blog about the German language.
* [DarkPhysicist](https://darkphysicist.wordpress.com/), High Energy Physics and related stuff.
* [RockAlterno](https://rockalterno.tumblr.com/), a tumblr blog about Alternative/Rock/Metal Music.
