Very _inspirational_ this talk presented in the [PyData London 2016](https://pydata.org/london2016/). In it, [**Tetiana Ivanova**](https://twitter.com/eoly23) describes her move from a position of Project Manager (_possibly similar to mine at present time..._) to one of Data Scientist.

She begins to talk about the "bubble" that education has undergone during the last two decades, a bubble that comes with an enormous increase in monetary investment to be able to afford a university degree. Tetiana also reflects on the benefit (or prejudice, in many cases) of continuing studies that end up with a PhD. From her point of view, this choice may occur a bit unconsciously (in the sense of not knowing well in which research project a student is going to dedicate 3-4 years), just because it is understood to be the "natural continuation" that is expected for someone who wants to strengthen his/her academic curriculum and successfully access to a very competitive labor market. She outlines the alternative approach she pursued to change her career, with a half-year self-training period, and how she focused her efforts to work as a Data Scientist.
