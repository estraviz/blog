Going on with the "experiment" that I started yesterday I've just seen this talk from the [PyCon 2017](https://us.pycon.org/2017/about/) about asynchronous programming in Python, by [**Miguel Grinberg**](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/). Miguel is also the author of [a well-known book](https://www.amazon.es/Flask-Web-Development-Developing-Applications/dp/1449372627/) from O'Reilly about [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.

The talk is not too long and has an introductory level, but fine for one who is not familiar with _asynchronous Python programming_. From here, there is a long way to go if one is interested in these topics. In my case, to go deeper some time later, not at the moment.

See [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) for a more technical detail on this module.
