# üìù Cracking the Data Science Interview[^1]

Another course from Safari Books that I've completed quickly: [_Cracking the Data Science Interview_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920039259.do "Cracking the Data Science Interview"). An easy following video series of just 2h 53 min by [**Jonathan Dinu**](http://hopelessoptimism.com/) and [**Katie Kent**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/katiekent/), directors of the Data Science programm at [**Galvanize, Inc**](http://www.galvanizeu.com/) when the course was recorded[^2]. Jonathan was one of the founders of [**Zipfian Academy**](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zipfian-academy#/entity), acquired by Galvanize in [November, 2014](http://blog.galvanize.com/galvanize-acquires-data-science-training-company-zipfian-academy/).

To better sense the purpose and content of the course, we can watch for free the following introduction:

{{< video "<https://cdnsecakmi.kaltura.com/p/1681692/sp/168169200/serveFlavor/entryId/0_gy3qfe0h/v/12/flavorId/0_b4h7enq8/forceproxy/true/name/a.mp4>" "Cracking the Data Science Interview" >}}

The course is structured in these areas:

    1. Introduction.
    2. Preparing for Interviews.
    3. Getting Interviews.
    4. Real-World Experiences.
    5. Mock Interviews.
    6. Negotiation.

I've found particularly useful the mock interviews, the section in which you can experience how this kind of processes take place and what kind of questions can be asked to the interviewee. In my case, not completeley new as I've been part of similar processes, then in the _IT Recruiter role_, up to not so long ago but from a different perspective.

BTW, there's also a link in O'Reilly's page for this book, pointing to [this resource](http://www.galvanize.com/resources/the-data-scientists-guide-to-interviewing) that returns a _beautiful_ 404. Nevertheless, the additional resources that should be there can be reached [here](http://52.24.101.88/resources/the-data-scientists-guide-to-interviewing/), or similarly [here](https://github.com/hopelessoptimism/cracking-the-data-science-interview), at Jonathan's github account. Jonathan is also one of the instructors of the [_Data Visualization and D3.js_](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507) free course by Udacity, a course that I should add to my personal [{{< awesome fab fa-github >}} **Data Science roadmap**](https://github.com/estraviz/data-science-roadmap), in the "Data Visualization and Reporting" section.

Nice course, as if you were watching a TED Talk, but a bit longer and with many insights to note down.
