# üìù Becoming a better programmer[^1]

Today I will leave here an entry about the 2015 conference by [**Peter Goodliffe**](http://www.goodliffe.net/), which is titled _Becoming a Better Programmer_. Something that, _a priori_, should be the goal of every software developer passionate about his profession (IMHO). Peter has a [book published by O'Reilly](https://www.amazon.es/Becoming-Better-Programmer-Handbook-People/dp/1491905530/) in 2014, with the same title.

This time, first the video on [{{< awesome fab fa-youtube >}} YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85fXs6cQETQ) and then some notes on it:

I have to confess that although the message and purpose of the talk fit with what I expected to hear, after completing the visualization I was not too enthusiastic. However, I emphasize the idea that Peter strives to make clear:

> {{< awesome fa fa-quote-right >}} _**It's all about ATTITUDE.**_
>
> --Peter Goodliffe

The attitude is determinant in the professional career (and in life), also for a programmer. The 46 minutes of talk have also served to discuss topics related to learning models:

* The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efecto_Dunning-Kruger): cognitive bias by which subjects with little knowledge or skills are believed to be better and smarter than others who are much better trained or prepared.

* The [Dreyfus model of skill acquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) (stages: _Novice -> Advanced Beginner -> Competent -> Proficient -> Expert_).

* The [_Knowledge Portfolio_](http://flylib.com/books/en/1.315.1.18/1/) (see [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer)).

* The 5 stages of learning:
  * Denial,
  * Anger,
  * Negotiation,
  * Depression,
  * Acceptance.

* _Yes_, in this video (_as in many others_) [**Malcolm Gladwell**](http://gladwell.com/) is quoted, the journalist and lecturer who popularized, in his work [_Outliers_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), the thesis that it is necessary a dedication of around 10,000 hours in the practice of a subject to reach a level of mastery in that matter.

That said, an interesting video but... I expected it better.
