# 📝 Domain-Driven Design Distilled[^1]

I currently have unlimited access to an enormous amount of books and videos through [safaribooksonline](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/). The paradise for anyone interested in software development. So, days ago, I thought of downloading a "light" videocourse that I could follow while commuting to work by tube. This [_Domain-Driven Design Distilled_](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/domain-driven-design-distilled/9780134593449/) is not exactly light in content, but at least I do not need to be in front of a code editor to follow.

The course is taught by [**Vaughn Vernon**](https://vaughnvernon.co/), author of the book [_Implementing Domain-Driven Design_](https://www.amazon.es/Implementing-Domain-Driven-Design-VaughnVernon/dp/0321834577/) of 2013, that had continuation last year with the book that gives name to the course that I have seen. My first approach to [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and without going through the already classic volume by [**Eric Evans**](https://twitter.com/ericevans0), [_Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software_](https://www.amazon.es/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/) (2003). This remains pending for me later (_for much later, I would say_).

The _Distilled_ version hasn't excited me much, _to be honest_, but it aroused some interest to me. It is for this reason that I keep as pending to read this reduced version of the same subject:
[_Domain-Driven Design Quickly_](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly), which can be downloaded for free from [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/).

To conclude, here we have an extract from the explanation of what is DDD, which we can read in [DDD Comunity](http://dddcommunity.org/):

> _**Domain-driven design (DDD)** is an approach to developing software for complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model of the core business concepts. Its premise is:_
>
> - _Place the project’s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic. Base complex designs on a **model**._
>
> - _Initiate a creative **collaboration** between technical and domain experts to iteratively cut ever closer to the conceptual heart of the problem._
>
> - _The premise is simple, but pulling it off in the messy real world is hard. It calls for new skills and discipline, and a systematic approach._
>
> _Domain-driven design is not a technology or a methodology. DDD provides a structure of practices and terminology for making design decisions that focus and accelerate software projects dealing with complicated domains._
